Yumthang which is at an altitude of 3658m (12000 ft) is situated about 135 kilometers from Gangtok in North Sikkim. But going there is like traveling 135 years back in time – it is so remote and almost untouched by the vagaries of civilization. Yumthang is located some 26 km away from Lachung. Where the tree line ends, the valley erupts in multi-colored meadows of flowers of Primula, Rhododendron, and other alpine flowers.",
